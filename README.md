PART-A(Theory) Answers
1)Mention the working of Internet Website in terms of Front-end and Back-end Divisions
Ans:- An internet website consists of two main divisions: the front-end and the back-end. Each division has its specific role and functionality in the overall 
functioning of a website.The term “front-end” refers to the user interface i.e users can interact directly with the website.Front-end developers design and 
construct the user experience elements on the web page or app including buttons, menus, pages, links, graphics and more.
 
 The primary technologies used in front-end development include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. 
 a. HTML: HTML is used to structure the content of a website, defining the layout of the page and organizing different elements such as headings, paragraphs, 
 images, links, forms, and more.

b. CSS: CSS is responsible for the visual styling of the website, including colors, fonts, layouts, and overall appearance. It allows developers to control 
the presentation of HTML elements and create an appealing user interface.

c. JavaScript: JavaScript adds interactivity to the website, enabling dynamic elements, animations, form validation, and more. It allows developers to create a responsive
and engaging user experience.

d. Front-end Frameworks: Developers often use front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js to simplify and streamline the development process. These frameworks
provide pre-built components, state management, and other tools for efficient front-end development.

Back-end:
The back-end is the server-side of a website that handles the behind-the-scenes operations and data processing. It includes the server, database, and server-side programming.
The core concern of back-end developers is in creating applications that can find and deliver data to the front end.

a. Server: The server hosts the website and responds to requests from users' browsers. It runs server-side software (e.g., Apache, Nginx) that manages the communication 
between the front-end and the back-end.

b. Database: The database stores and manages the website's data, including user information, content, and other relevant data. Common database systems include MySQL, 
PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.

c. Server-side Programming: Server-side programming languages (such as Python, PHP, Ruby, or Node.js) are used to handle the business logic and process user requests. 
They interact with the database, handle authentication, perform calculations, and generate dynamic content to be displayed on the front-end.

d. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): APIs are used to facilitate communication and data exchange between the front-end and the back-end or between different 
systems. They allow developers to retrieve or send data in a standardized manner.

e. Back-end Frameworks: Back-end frameworks like Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), or Laravel (PHP) provide a structured environment for building web applications 
efficiently. They offer libraries, tools, and conventions to simplify common back-end tasks.

Therefore the front-end focuses on the presentation and user interface of a website, while the back-end handles server-side processing, data management, and communication 
with the front-end. Both divisions work together to deliver a functional, visually appealing, and interactive website to the users.
